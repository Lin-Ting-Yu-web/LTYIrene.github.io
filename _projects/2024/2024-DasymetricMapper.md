description: >-
  This repository contains the computer code that supported the publication of our research: "Multi-source Tri-environmental Conceptual Framework for Fire Impact Analysis" (under review in Urban Informatics). This package helps researchers quickly generate high-resolution population density layers using dasymetric mapping, a sophisticated geospatial technique that leverages detailed land cover data to distribute demographic data across predefined spatial units, such as census blocks.
