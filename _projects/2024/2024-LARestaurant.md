  This data science project aims to perform a geospatial analysis of socioeconomic status and its impact on restaurant distribution across Los Angeles County. By leveraging diverse web sources, this study examines the correlation between socioeconomic factors — like education and income — and the variety of restaurants available in different areas. The goal is to understand how these elements influence food service diversity, contributing valuable insights into urban planning and social equity.
