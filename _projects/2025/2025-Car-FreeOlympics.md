  This project assesses the feasibility of a “car-free” 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where all venue access relies on public transport. Using the Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method, it analyzes accessibility, evaluating infrastructure, population density, and socioeconomic factors. By mapping the accessibility index (AI) across neighborhoods, the study examines whether the transit network can support the event. Future directions explore equity in access and the long-term transportation legacy of the Games.
