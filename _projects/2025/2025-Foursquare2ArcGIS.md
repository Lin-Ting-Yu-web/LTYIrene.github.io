description: >-
  Foursquare Open Source Places (FSQ OS Places) is a high-quality, open POI (Points of Interest) dataset released by Foursquare, containing over 104 million POIs worldwide. While platforms like OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Overture Maps aim to improve open POI coverage, FSQ OS Places provides a more extensive and precise dataset.
  This repository provides a step-by-step guide on downloading POI data and converting it from GeoJSON to Shapefile (SHP) for use in ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, and other GIS applications.
